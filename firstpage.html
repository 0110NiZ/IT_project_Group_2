            <p class="description">
                <h2>The Eight Cuisines of China</h2>
                <br>
                Eating habits vary greatly from place to place in China. 
                <br>
                In terms of what people eat, as a result of the differences in the kinds of food grown in different parts of China, dietary habits are also varied from region to region. Rice tends to be the staple crop in the south of the country, whereas wheat (and hence products made from flour, such as noodles and dumplings) is consumed more in the north. Non-staple food is mainly meat, eggs and a variety of vegetables, but affected by the climate, there are relatively fewer varieties of vegetables in the north in winter.
                <br>
                Due to the differences in climate, products and living habits in different parts of China, people's tastes are also different. Generally speaking, people from Jiangsu and Zhejiang have a sweet tooth and tend to put some sugar in dishes; northerners favor salty flavors and put more salt in their dishes; people from Hunan and Sichuan prefer spicy food and they often use chilli peppers in their cooking; Shanxi is famed for its vinegar and people from this region can't do without vinegar in their dishes. Therefore. there is an old saying in China, "Sweet south, salty north, peppery east and sour west".
                <br>
                In terms of flavor, China boasts many cuisines in different regions, the most famous of which are the following eight: Guangdong/Cantonese cuisine, Sichuan cuisine, Shandong cuisine, Jiangsu cuisine, Zhejiang cuisine, Fujian cuisine, Hunan cuisine and Anhui cuisine.Each cuisine has its representative dishes, such as Kung Pao Chicken (Sichuan cuisine), Sweet and Sour Yellow River Carp (Shandong cuisine), Sauteed Fish Head with Diced Spicy Pepper (Hunan cuisine), Longjing Shelled Shrimps (Zhejiang cuisine), ect.

                <h3>Savoury and fresh flavours</h3>
                <p>Pay attention to the excellent texture of raw materials, salt to improve freshness, soup to strengthen the freshness, flavouring the pure salty, highlighting the original taste. Salty and fresh is the main fire exquisite, good at making soup, good at cooking seafood. Cuisine is very much about flavouring clear, creamy soups. </p>

                <img src="picture/bada2.jpg" width="220px">
                <h3>Spicy and numbing flavours</h3>
                <p>Variety of dishes, fresh, mellow and thick flavours, with good use of spicy seasoning, prticularly the pungency and spiciness resulting from liberal use of garlic and chili peppers, as well as the unique flavor of the Sichuan peppercorn. The raw materials are mainly mountain treasures and aquatic products from the territory of Sichuan area. </p>
            </div>

                <img src="picture/bada3.jpg" width="220px">
                <h3>Light flavours</h3>
                <p>The ingredients are rigorous, with emphasis on colour matching and modelling, and there are differences between the four seasons. Cooking techniques are known for stewing, braising and simmering; emphasis is placed on adjusting the soup, keeping the original juice, and the flavour is calm. Good use of vegetables.   </p>

                <img src="picture/bada4.jpg" width="220px">
                <h3>Fresh flavours</h3>
                <p>The selection of ingredients is fine, clear but not bland, tender but not raw, and oily but not greasy. It specialises in small stir-fry, which requires just the right amount of fire and oil temperature. It is also compatible with many western food practices, and pays attention to the momentum and class of the dish.</p>

It has three characteristics: one is good at seasoning with red dregs, the other is good at making soup, and the third is good at using sugar and vinegar. Fujian is located on the south-east coast, people are good at cooking seafood.                                                                </p>

                <img src="picture/bada6.jpg" width="220px">
                <h3>Mild flavours</h3>
                <p>The dishes are small and delicate, clean and handsome, fresh and tender, crisp and soft.

                <p>It is good at burning, stewing and steaming, while there are fewer explosive and stir-fry dishes, which are heavy on oil, colour and fire power. Its uniqueness is concentrated in the kung fu dishes which are good at burning, stewing, smoking and steaming.                                                              </p>
